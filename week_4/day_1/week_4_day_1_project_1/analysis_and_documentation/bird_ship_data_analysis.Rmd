# Question 1
Which bird had the most individual sightings?

```{r}
bird_most_sightings <- bird_ship_data %>%
  group_by(bird_common_name,bird_scientific_name,bird_abbreviation) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
bird_most_sightings
```
 

 2.Which bird had the highest total count?

```{r}
# Step 1 : first select the birds which have the same common name, scientific name and abbrevation and count. ( and then)
# Step 2 : Group your data as per record_id,bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, bird_abbreviation.
# Step 2 : Once this is done and you have your group add the respective counts and assing it to a new variable sum_of_bird_count
# Step 3 : Arrange in descending order , the bird with the highest count will appear first

#deaths <- select(all_deaths, name, allegiances, gender, nobility, year_of_death) 

bird_highest_count <- 
  select(bird_ship_data,bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, bird_abbreviation, count) %>%
        group_by(bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, bird_abbreviation) %>%
        summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%
        #mutate(count, sum_of_bird_count = sum(count)) %>%
        arrange(desc(count))
        
bird_highest_count                      
  
```


3.Which bird had the highest total count above a latitude of -30?

```{r}
# Step 1 : Select only the counts where in Latitude > -30
# Step 2 : and then select the birds which have the same common name, scientific name and abbrevation,
# Step 2 : Once this is done and you have your group add the respective counts and assing it to a new variable count_sum
# Step 3 : Arrange in descending order , the bird with the highest count will appear first

bird_count_latitude <- 
  select(bird_ship_data, bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, bird_abbreviation, count,latitude) %>%
   group_by(bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, bird_abbreviation)%>%
   filter(latitude > -30) %>%
   summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%
   arrange(desc(count))

bird_count_latitude

```



4.How many different types of birds were only ever seen in groups of 1?

```{r}

# Step 1:  select common name, scientific name, abbrevation , count
# Step 2 : group by first 3 line items
# Step 2 : check if common name, scientific name and abbrevation are repeated, if they are repeated drop them
# Step 3 : this will give us the list of birds which were only ever seen in groups of one.
# Step 4 : count their total i.e number of rows

bird_count_1 <- 
  select(bird_ship_data, bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, bird_abbreviation, count) %>%
      group_by(bird_common_name, bird_scientific_name, bird_abbreviation)%>%
      summarise(count = max(1))%>%
      filter(count == 1)%>%
      nrow()
bird_count_1

```

5.How many penguins were seen? (Hint: there are many types of penguin)

```{r}

#Step 1 : select common name
#Step 2 : from common name filter only names which contains the word penguin Eg : contains("bo") for book
#Step 3 : share the count

View(bird_ship_data)

bird_count_penguins <- select(bird_common_name, count) %>%
  
  select(contains("bo"))

```
