# Now lets look in detail at the Business Requirements i.e the analysis questions and start deep cleaning
# the data as per the questions asked

#Analysis questions

# 1> What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. 
#     (number of candy ratings, not number of raters. Donâ€™t count missing values)

# distinct(candy_2015_clean, candy_name)

#Ans : On the face of it we have 93 different types of candy in 2015, 100 in 2016 and 103 in 2017, so approx
#the answer to this question should be somewhere between 100 to 110 keeping in mind most of the cancy have been repeated.

# 2> What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating and the average age of people 
#3. not going trick or treating?
#Answer :
#  First we need to see to that the the variable names match , which is done, then we need to check all the unique 
# items in the variable names.
# So now we know,2015 has yes / no , same with 2016 and 2017 has yes/no/NA, hence data is good to go
  distinct(candy_2017_clean,trick_or_treat_yourself)

# 3> For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar revived the most of these ratings?
# Answer : In 2017 emotion has only NA / MEH / DISPAIR / JOY same with 2016, in 2015 there are only 3 JOY/ NA/DISPARE,which 
# is fine, so data is good to go.

  distinct(candy_2017_clean,emotion)
  
  
# 4> How many people rated Starburst as despair?
# data is clean enugh to answer this
  distinct( candy_2015_clean, candy_name)

#For the next three questions, count despair as -1, joy as +1 and meh as 0.

# 5> What was the most popular candy bar by this rating system for each gender in the dataset?
  distinct( candy_2015_clean, gender)
  
# 6> What was the most popular candy bar in each year?
#probably to answer this question wil have to add 3 more columns for candy_name_2015 / candy_name_2016 / candy_name_2017
  
# 7> What was the most popular candy bar by this rating for people in US, Canada, UK and all other countries?
# to answer this question, all country names will have to be cleaned first
