1. If I roll a six-sided dice once, what is the probability of getting a number less than 5?
```{r}
s_one_dice <- rolldie(1)

# how large is the sample space? 
ss_one_dice <- s_one_dice %>%
  nrow()

# event space for roll of a total of seven
s_sum_lessthan_five <- s_one_dice %>%
  filter(X1 < 5) %>%
  nrow()

probability_lessthan_five <- s_sum_lessthan_five / ss_one_dice

probability_lessthan_five
```

2. How many outcomes are there in the sample space of an experiment in which we toss three dice?

```{r}
s_three_dice <- rolldie(3) %>%
  nrow()

s_three_dice
```

3. In an experiment where we roll four dice:

1. how many outcomes are in the event total_equals_5_6_7 (i.e. the total of the four dice equals 5, 6 or 7)?
2. what is the probability of this event?
3. what assumptions do we apply in answering part ii? And - Order does not matter.

```{r}

s_four_dice <- rolldie(4)

s_four_dice_five <- s_four_dice %>%
  mutate(sum = X1 +X2 +X3 +X4) %>%
  filter(sum == 5) %>%
  nrow()

s_four_dice_six <- s_four_dice %>%
  mutate(sum = X1 +X2 +X3 +X4 )%>%
  filter(sum == 6) %>%
  nrow()

s_four_dice_seven <- s_four_dice %>%
  mutate(sum = X1 +X2 +X3 +X4) %>%
  filter(sum == 7) %>%
  nrow()

total_equals_5_6_7 = s_four_dice_five + s_four_dice_six + s_four_dice_seven

total_equals_5_6_7

probability_five_six_seven = total_equals_5_6_7 / nrow(s_four_dice)

probability_five_six_seven
```

4. Five chairs are placed in a row in a room, along with five people of differing height. The people sit down randomly on the chairs. What is the probability that they sit in order of decreasing height, left to right?

```{r}
people_height <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")

random_seating <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 5, 
                                  r = 5, 
                                  v = people_height, repeats.allowed = FALSE))

decreasing_heights <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 5, 
                                  r = 5, 
                                  v = people_height, repeats.allowed = FALSE)) %>%
  filter( V1 == "A", V2 == "B", V3 == "C", V4 == "D", V5 == "E")


probability_decreasing_heights = nrow(decreasing_heights) / nrow(random_seating)

probability_decreasing_heights
```

5. I roll six dice:

1. what is the probability I see the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 in order on the dice, left to right?
2. what is the probability I see one each of the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 on the dice regardless of order?

```{r}
s_six_dice <- rolldie(6)

in_order_left_to_right <- s_six_dice %>%
  filter(X1 == 6, X2 == 5, X3 == 4, X4 == 3, X5 == 2, X6 == 1)

probability_in_order = nrow(in_order_left_to_right)/ nrow(s_six_dice)

probability_in_order

probability_to_see_each_number <- (6*5*4*3*2*1) / nrow(s_six_dice)

probability_to_see_each_number

```

6. If I draw a single card from a 52-card deck, and it is black, what is the probability that its suit is spades?

```{r}
chances_of_card_being_spade = 12 / 24
chances_of_card_being_spade
```

7. Eight patients: Alice, Bob, Carmen, Dinesh, Ella, Fergus, Gianna and Henry are waiting to see a doctor, but only five appointment slots are left today.

1.In how many different orders can the doctor see patients today?
```{r}
# create vector of choices contains eight patients, n = 10.

patients <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Carmen", "Dinesh", "Ella", "Fergus", "Gianna", "Henry")

# Only 5 appointment slots left for today, r = 5
# Don't replace a patient once chosen: repeats.allowed = FALSE

different_orders <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 8, 
                                  r = 5, 
                                  v = patients, repeats.allowed = FALSE)) %>%
                                  nrow()

different_orders
```
2. What is the probability of Gianna and Danesh both being seen today?
```{r}
different_orders_filter <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 8, 
                                  r = 5, 
                                  v = patients, repeats.allowed = FALSE)) %>%
  filter( V1 == "Gianna", V2 == "Dinesh")

probability_of_gianna_dinesh <- nrow(different_orders_filter)/ nrow(different_orders)

probability_of_gianna_dinesh
```

3. What is the probability of Gianna being seen before Dinesh today?
```{r}

```

4.  Carmen and Henry have now been triaged as high priority and will be seen in the first two available slots, although their order hasnâ€™t yet been determined. In how many different orders can the patients now be seen?
```{r}
# Carman and Henry and be seen in 2 orders,either Carman goes first or Henry Goes First

# Rest of the patioets there are 7 patients left and there are 3 slots available, this can be done as follows :

patient_new <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Dinesh", "Ella", "Fergus", "Gianna")

# Only 5 appointment slots left after Carman and Henry have taken the first two slots, r = 3
# Don't replace a patient once chosen: repeats.allowed = FALSE

different_orders <- as_tibble(permutations(n = 6, 
                                  r = 3, 
                                  v = patient_new, repeats.allowed = FALSE)) %>%
                                  nrow() 

different_orders * 2



```

8. If order is not significant, how many ways are there to select a 5 student quiz team from a group of 8 students?

```{r}
quiz_taem <- choose(8,5)
quiz_taem
```
